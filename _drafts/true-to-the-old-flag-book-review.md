_True to The Old Flag_ by G. A Henty is one of Henty's most disappointing books.  It is centered around The American War for Independence. This tale follows 15 year old Harold Wilson an American Loyalist. He fights Indians, Americans, and serves as a scout for the British Army in Canada.

At the commencement of the story Harold Wilson is living with his Mother's Cousin, on a frontier settlement. When the Indians attack, he is out in a canoe on the lake with his Cousin Nelly Welch. Because of the training he went through in the past few months he was able to bring them both back safely.q
