> “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.”

Bookended by some of the most recognizable quotes in the english language,  _A Tale of Two Cities_, is a work of art, crafted by an amazing writer.  The tale is centered around Dr. Alexandre Manette and his daughter Lucie.  At the time the story starts Dr. Manette has just been released from an 18-year long prison sentence. Later in the story the reader learns that he was put in prison to suppress proof crime.

At the beginning of the book Dr. Manette is in a sore state of mind, but under the care of his loving daughter, Lucie, he slowly recovered his wits.

In the second part of the book, Charles Darnay, an émigré from france is being tried by the English Government, as a spy. The two main witnesses against him are British spies, John Barsad and Roger Cly, who claim that Darnay gave information about British troops in America to the French. When Barsad says he could recognize Darnay anywhere, Mr. Stryver (Darnay's Barristar), points out the strong resemblance  between him and his collegue Sydney Carton.  Barsad  is then forced to admits that they look almost identical. With Barsad's eye witness account discredited, Darnay is released.

As the story progresses Darnay asks permission of Dr. Manette to marry Lucie, but Sydney Carton also confesses his love to Lucie as well, knowing she will not love him in return.  Carton said:

> “‎And yet I have had the weakness, and have still the weakness, to wish you to know with what a sudden mastery you kindled me, heap of ashes that I am, into fire.”

and:

> “For you, and for any dear to you, I would do anything. If my career were of that better kind that there was any opportunity or capacity of sacrifice in it, I would embrace any sacrifice for you and for those dear to you. Try to hold me in your mind, at some quiet times, as ardent and sincere in this one thing. The time will come, the time will not be long in coming, when new ties will be formed about you--ties that will bind you yet more tenderly and strongly to the home you so adorn--the dearest ties that will ever grace and gladden you. O Miss Manette, when the little picture of a happy father's face looks up in yours, when you see your own bright beauty springing up anew at your feet, think now and then that there is a man who would give his life, to keep a life you love beside you!”

Carton is  a brilliant but depressed and cynical drunkard. He is constantly referring to what he calls his "bad luck".  He loathes himself because of what he sees as a wasted life. When Lucie tries to compel him to start his life anew, he says:

> _”It is too late for that. I shall never be better than I am. I shall sink lower, and be worse.”_

### Summary

This book confirms what I have been told, mainly, Charles Dickens was a great writer.  Although the build-up is a little lengthy, and it is hard to connect with any one the the main characters, Charles Dickens know how to make the punch line hammer! After finishing the book I was not sure whether to laugh or cry, so I re-read it!  _A Tale of Two Cities_ does have some long sentences, and is bit wordy, but for all that it is a must-read if enjoy historical-fiction.

> "A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it!" - Charles Dickens, A Tale of  Two Cities

### ⚠ **Spoiler Alert** ⚠

***

  
Charles Darnay, Lucie's husband, is arrested and put in prison and sentenced to death. Just hours before the sentence is to be carried out Sydney Carton changes places with him. And is killed in his place. His last unspoken thoughts are prophetic:

> “I see that I hold a sanctuary in their hearts, and in the hearts of their descendants, generations hence. I see her, an old woman, weeping for me on the anniversary of this day. I see her and her husband, their course done, lying side by side in their last earthly bed, and I know that each was not more honoured and held sacred in the other's soul, than I was in the souls of both...
>
> “It is a far, far better thing that I do, than I have ever done; it is a far, far better rest that I go to than I have ever known.”

The main theme of the book is resurrection, Dr. Manette is "recalled to life". In Carton's last words we see this theme again.

> “I am the Resurrection and the Life, saith the Lord: he that believeth in me, though he were dead, yet shall he live: and whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die.”
