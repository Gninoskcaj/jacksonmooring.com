> “It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of light, it was the season of darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair.”

Bookended by some of the most recognizable quotes in the english language,  _A Tale of Two Cities_, is a work of art, crafted by an amazing writer.  The tale is centered around Dr. Alexandre Manette and his daughter Lucie.  At the time the story starts Dr. Manette has just been released from an 18-year long prison sentence. Later in the story the reader learns that he was put in prison to keep him quiet about a rape and murder he witnessed.

At the beginning of the book Dr. Manette is in a sore state of mind, but under the care of his loving daughter, Lucie, he slowly recovers his witts. 

> _"A wonderful fact to reflect upon, that every human creature is constituted to be that profound secret and mystery to every other. A solemn consideration, when I enter a great city by night, that every one of those darkly clustered houses encloses its own secret; that every room in every one of them encloses its own secret; that every beating heart in the hundreds of thousands of breasts there, is, in some of its imaginings, a secret to the heart nearest it!"_

A Tale of Two Cities is full of long wordy sentences, full of long illustrious words.
