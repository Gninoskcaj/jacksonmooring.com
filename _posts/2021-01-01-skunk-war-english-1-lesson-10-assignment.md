I was walking back to the house one night after penning up the cow, And I ran right into a skunk coming to our house. I jumped aside so that the spray would miss me, but I was a little too late. The skunk sprayed the side of my jeans, but what he didn't know was that he had signed his death warrant.

It was a bright winter morning, the air was a little chilly, but the sun had come out and warmed up the earth. About a week had past since I had declared war on skunks after that wicked weasel sprayed me, but that was not on my mind at the moment because I was in the shop feeding the cow. Suddenly, all the chickens around the shop squawked and flew in all directions. Knowing something was wrong, I ran out of the shop. An guess what I saw, A fat skunk running at full speed towards the south fence of our property. I grabbed a heavy metal bar and ran after it. When I felt I was in range, I threw my metal bar at the skunk, and I hit! The skunk stopped running, rolled over two or three times, got back up, and started running again at twice the speed. I threw the bar again and again, but never hit him. The skunk had got away once more!

Ever since the last skunk indecent, I always carried a gun when I went out to do stuff with the cows. Well, this time it was a dark, cold, foggy, winter night. As I trudged through that grass, I thought about all sorts of things, that I never would have had time to reflect on, had I not, every morning, and every evening, when it was dark, light, cold, hot, foggy, rainy, stormy, snowy, windy, when the stars were bright, when they weren't, when I was sad, happy, or angry, trudged through that familiar grass, to pen up that familiar cow. This time I thought about skunks. I though a lot about skunks. I thought about when I would see skunks, and when I would shoot them. But, I finally concluded that as long as I was expecting to see a skunk, I wouldn't see one. So, as I trudged on, my thoughts wandered on. My muse got deeper and deeper, 'till I was moving mechanically, to do the chore so deeply ingrained in muscle memory. I trudged on and on. The night got darker and darker. The sun sank beneath the mountains to the far west.

I was sharply awakened to reality, to see a white streak (the trademark symbol of the striped skunk), dart across the path 30 yards in front of me, without the slightest hesitation I pulled my single-action .22 revolver from its holster; I had six shots, numb fingers, and a moonless and foggy night. I started running. The chase had began.

Every time I pulled the trigger, a blinding flash of light, and a hollow-point capsule of  death, shot out that 7" barrel. After three shots, the critter was dead. After three more shots, the weasel would never walk again.

And so closes one of my many stories that weaves into the greater story of me. We all have stories, we all have lives, that weave together into the greater story of the one who created us. We are living _His_ story.
