  <h1>Hey Friends:wave:</h1>
  <p>
	Hi, my name is Jackson. I am a homeschool high school student, as well as a, reader, coder, aspiring entrepreneur, and a child of God. I love to be productive, to be helpful, to give, and to get stuff done. I like to study, work, eat, read, live, and run. My day generally starts at 4AM and ends at 8PM. Every day I spend 2 hours of my time participating productive recreation. My pleasure reading generally consists of historical fiction, or historical non-fiction.

 	 I like to think that I have a big imagination. I prefer to think about what I say before I say it, in order to avoid making a mistake. I would rather do an extra Algebra lesson than eat a mushroom. I would rather write an extra paper than do an extra Algebra lesson. I love Algebra. I hate mushrooms. My pet-peeve is getting interupted for no reason at all. I have 8 cute siblings.
